hi. welcome to the contribution guide of medx open-source project.
it's nice to have you here. and this is a guiding document aims to help the people who are willing to contribute to the medx open-source project. you can read about its why [here](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/MedX/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION-WHY.md) if you haven't read it yet.

first of all, you should know that we encourage any contribution. even if it doesn't meet this document. because we consider any contribution a help and help is good for its own sake. so this document is just for a bit better help for those who want to help more.

we should also emphasis that this is an open-source project meaning that you can contribute to everything. even this document itself. so please never hesitate about "can i contribute to this part or not?".

# issues
### when we create an issue?
when we want to work on something, we create an issue. when we see that something needs to be worked on, by ourselves or by others, we create an issue too.

### how to create an issue?
go to the issues tab of the project and click on the 'new issue'. this is how you can create an issue. but care about the following principles:
- assigns: every issue must be **assigned to a person**. so if you're creating an issue, make sure to assign it to a person. that person could be yourself too.
- deadlines: make sure to determine the **deadline** for every issue. we don't consider it an issue to work on, even if it has a deadline.
- tags: every issue should have **at least one tag**. tags are clear and use them correctly. for example, if that issue is a good starting issue for a new contributor (it doesn't need advanced knowledge), set 'good first issue' to it. if it's a bug, set 'bug' to it. if it's a new feature you think should be developed, set ''enhancement' to it. etc.
- 
### who is responsible for the results of an issue?
**all** assigned people are responsible. but if there is more than one person, the person who **created an issue and set its deadline** is responsible.



wait some days please, it's being completed...
