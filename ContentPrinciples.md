This guide is for writers who want to contribute content to the MedX platform. If you’re unsure about whether your content will be featured on our website, this guide outlines our content selection process.

## principles:
- your content should be **authentic**. you shouldn't copy/translate it from anyone else on the internet.
- you should write in **persian language**, considering all its **grammatical, spelling, and punctuation tips**.
- we prefer content which are **simultaneously related to tech and health**.
- we prefer content about the **new things**! the newer, the better!
We'd love for creators to share their work on MedX, a platform with a growing user base and exposure across various media!
Currently, we don't have a self-submission system on our website. To have your content considered for publication, you can simply email it to "medxmedia.net@gmail.com". We're working on a self-service system for the next weeks, allowing you to directly post your content with all the website's features.
