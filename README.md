# MedX
## what it is?
MedX is an open-source media platform for med people to explore, learn, and share in the world of health tech.

# who we are?
the first contributors are some medical people! @sinusealpha, @aref-asadi, and @hossein-kazzemi are those who started this project. but as it goes, other people can contribute to it to help us in our shared purpose -- medicalizing tech world for medical (and in a broader version, non-technical) people.

# what is our vision?
our vision is a world in which almost all medical people can explore, learn and even contribute to the world of tech, from their side. we believe that this will change healthcare more than any other linear innovations.

# what stage we are in? (this updates as time goes)
as you can see in the issues tab. we are designing the website's pages to be developed in the next few days.

# how can anyone contribute?
you can contribute directly and freely through this repository. you can share it to the people who are willing to contribute to this purpose and you can also apply to be in our main team with this [form]().
