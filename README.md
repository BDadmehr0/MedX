# MedX
## what is MedX?
MedX is an open-source media platform for med people to explore, learn, share, and contribute to the world of health tech.  
---> find our website at www.medxmedia.net (launching soon!)  
---> you can also follow us on [telegram](https://t.me/medxmedia_net), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/medxmedia_net) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/medxstartup).  

## who we are?
the first contributors are some med people themselves! [sina](https://github.com/Sinusealpha), [aref](https://github.com/aref-asadi), and [hossein](https://github.com/hossein-kazzemi) are those who started this project. but as it goes, anyone can contribute to our shared purpose -- helping med people to have an impact in the health tech world. we believe that, shortly, we need super-empowered med people, and changing healthcare is going through the path of empowering med people.

## what is our vision?
our vision is a world in which almost all medical people can explore, learn and even contribute to the world of tech, from their side. we believe that this will change healthcare more than any other linear innovations. 

## what is going on inside of the medx team?
as we are an open startup, we issues almost anything we're working on. we also publish monthly reports in our [newsletter](https://medxmedia.substack.com/) and our [inside medx telegram channel](https://t.me/insidemedx).

## how can 'anyone' contribute?
anyone can contribute directly and freely through this public repository. but before contribution, please read our [contributions guideline](). we're also actively seeking same-purposed people to be in our main team and if you see yourself as this person, please fill out this [form]() and we'll message you as soon as possible if there are/aren't any chance.
