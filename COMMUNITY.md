As an open-source project, we are already a community. We have dedicated spaces for developers to engage in discussions about MedX development and related topics.

You can freely discuss any aspect of the project in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/MedX/discussions).
You can also join our [developers' community](https://t.me/+0i9Cal72Q8dlOTY8) on Telegram.

These are the two primary platforms for discussing the development of MedX. We also encourage you to build your community throughout MedX's developmentâ€”your contributions are more than welcome!
