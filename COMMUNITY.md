as we are an open-source project, we are already a community. so we have some places for developers to be around and talk about medx development and other related things.  

---> you can freely talk about every part of the project in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/MedX/discussions).  
---> you can also join our medx developer community on [telegram](https://t.me/+0i9Cal72Q8dlOTY8).  

here are two main places we have to talk about the development, especially about medx. but you can build your community around medx's development if you're interested and that's more than welcome.
